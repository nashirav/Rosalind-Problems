Finding a Shared Motif
======================
***Problem

A common substring of a collection of strings is a substring of every member of the collection.
We say that a common substring is a longest common substring if there does not exist a longer
common substring. For example, "CG" is a common substring of "ACGTACGT" and "AACCGGTATA", but 
it is not as long as possible; in this case, "GTA" is a longest common substring of "ACGTACGT" 
and "AACCGTATA".Note that the longest common substring is not necessarily unique; for a simple
example, "AA" and "CC" are both longest common substrings of "AACC" and "CCAA".

Given: A collection of k (kâ‰¤100) DNA strings of length at most 1 kbp each in FASTA format.
Return: A longest common substring of the collection. (If multiple solutions exist, you may 
return any single solution.)
